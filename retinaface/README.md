# RetinaFace
This is a modified version of this [Tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/serengil/retinaface) of the RetinaFace model.

The major changes are as follows:

1. Removed all unneeded functionality related to extraction of faces
2. Updated to use fixed input image dimensions to allow conversion to TF-lite
